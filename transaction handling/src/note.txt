you must know/understand what is data consistency before starting transaction handling  in jdbc.

data consistency: data consistency in JDBC refers to ensuring that data remains uniform and accurate across different transactions and database operations.
for instance, transaction b/w two bank accounts. debit and credit only occuring b/w the two accounts.
the overall data in database still remains if wwe do a sum of all transaction.
no loss no gain, right!
that's called data consistency.


TWO METHODS FOR TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT:
1. commit
2. rollback
