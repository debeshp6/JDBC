ResultSet interface is used only while we retrieve data.
when we do some kinda insertion, that time we use/create a local variable 'rowsAffected'.
if rowsAffected is greater than 0 means insertion is complete.
overall, we don't use ResultSet in data insertion. remember, that is only used while retrieving data.
